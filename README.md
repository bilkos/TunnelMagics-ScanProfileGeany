# Tunnel Magics - Scan Profile Geany

Python app for generating simulated scan data of a measured profile.\n
Used in tunnel construction surveying and geodesy calculations.

## Disclaimer

App is currently written for Slovenian language... So I am very sorry, to everyone in advance.\n
When I get to it I will translate it to english or maybe even create a language pack.
